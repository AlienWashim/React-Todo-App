# React Todo App 📝

A simple and elegant Todo App built using React and Bootstrap to manage daily tasks efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Todo App allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It also features priority levels (normal, medium, high) with visual indicators and uses Bootstrap styling with popover action buttons. It’s a lightweight, interactive task manager built with React Hooks.
